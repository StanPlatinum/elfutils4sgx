~~cp from my laptop: ~/dyninst4sgxminidep/dyninst-build/elfutils~~

~~actually, the main dir should be ./src, and the build dir is ./src/LibElf-build~~

if we don't use libelf to analysis the elf format file, then we need a trampoline/springboard (for musl libc to invoke syscall).

the source code is in the libelf dir
